Keyswitch: any keyswitch should be fine, whether the switch used is from Wooting, Gateron, Kailh, or something sold on Aliexpress

Size: small enough so that its portable but not too small that everything becomes cramped and tiny

Features: -4 keys for movement on the left side (Arrow key style) -8 keys on the right with some gap in between movement and other 8 (PS buttons: A,B,X,Y,R1,L1,R2,L2)
:Tiny Buttons on the top making them accesible but hard to hit (PS Buttons: Options, Touchpad button, PS button, Share button, Movement button [To swap from the movement keys from being dpad to left stick to right stick, etc])
:Support for PC, PS4/5, and Nintendo Switch (if I can lmao)
:Screen on it cause screens are cool, might have a buttom to swap the display from button overview to analogue trigger overview

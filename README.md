# Stick-s-Stick
A design of an analogue fightpad (fightstick, mixbox, whatever the name is idk). Open Source

Copied from my twitter qRT about it:
  "I was planning on forking a repo for a 3k hall effect osu! keypad, possibly turning that into a 12 key fight pad for fighting games turns out the RP2040 can only handle 4 analogue inputs so i'm unable to use that, guess we'll have to go a different method... or compromise... my idea for the pad is basically something like the Haute 42 but crossed with the Wooting UwU. The compromise i mention was making only the movement keys hall effect, but there's benefits to making the attack buttons hall effect as well. hmm... this is a predicament"
